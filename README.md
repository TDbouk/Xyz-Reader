# XyZ-Reader

An Android app representing a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. The feeds are shown in a staggered view. A View Pager is used to implement the detail view where the user can read further details.  

## Why this project?

The main goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of Android design, apply material design guidelines, and use surfaces, transitions, and motion by transforming a developed app across multiple factors. In addition, this projects lets the student view and interact with code that is written by someone else. Finally, the project's requirements replicate a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
